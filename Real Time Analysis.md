Project 1: Traffic Controllers that work based on the Density of vehicles at a particular moment

Description: This project involves varying traffic controllers rather than the conventional traffic controllers, which have fixed time interval irrespective of presence and absence of vehicles. Using IR scanners and the response they give back the traffic controllers can vary their time intervals hence reducing the time lost in waiting for no use.
This circuit consists of 4 IR sensors, atmega8 microcontroller, 4 traffic lights.
