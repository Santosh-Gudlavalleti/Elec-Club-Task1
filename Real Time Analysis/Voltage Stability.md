Project 3: Irregular Voltage Alarm
Description: This device rings an alarm when there is a sudden hike or drop in the voltage, this is cost efficient compared to the conventional Voltage stabilisers, The frequent energization or de-energization of relays leads to the shortening the life time of appliances and the stabilizer itself. Hence it is better to use this project in order to control the appliances instead of costly stabilizers.
Centre tapped transformer, Timer, resistors are few components that are needed
